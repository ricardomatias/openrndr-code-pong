# code-pong-2

Coding game. Two people. OPENRNDR. Second try.

## Rules

Clone the repo, edit max 5 lines (Example: add 2 lines, edit 2 lines, delete 1 line), push changes, wait for your turn, repeat :)

I wonder if we can verify the changes? If we do

    git diff --shortstat

and I changed 1 line and added 4 lines, the stats show 5 lines inserted and 1
line deleted. Maybe the rule could be changed to having that command show
```inserted <= 5 && deleted <= 5``` ?

## To be figured out

* How do you know when it's your turn? Maybe at the top of the file we have a comment mentioning whose turn it is? So if I edit, I add you as next editor. Then more than 2 people could play.
* Do comments compute as changed lines?
